                    Our science-first approach creates music that 
                    sounds different—and affects your brain differently—than any other music.

                        Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music,
                         including technology to elicit <strong>strong neural phase locking</strong>—allowing 
                         populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity—and technology to remove distraction in sound.</p>
                    <p class="p3">This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words, we’ve found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.</p>

                        Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions 
                        to run experiments.

                    <p class="p2">
                        We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG,
                        and also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.
                    </p>
                    <p class="p3">
                    <strong>Our experiments always include a control condition (placebo)</strong>
                     of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied,
                      so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference.
